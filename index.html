	<h1>Hi there, I'm Lisa Hou!</h1>
	<p>I'm currently a software engineer at <a href="https://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>. I was born and raised in China and I came to the States in 2015 for my undergraduate education. I graduated in 2018 from <a href="https://www.ucsd.edu">University of California, San Diego</a> with a major in <a href="https://www.math.ucsd.edu/~handbook/undergraduate/ma30-math-computer-science-b-s/">Mathematics-Computer Science</a> and a minor in Cognitive Science. After that, I continued my education and graduated in 2019 from <a href="https://mcds.cs.cmu.edu/">"Master of Computational Data Science"</a> at Carnegie Mellon University, with a concentration on analytics. If you are interested in a more detailed overview of my experience, please feel free to navigate to my <a href="/cv">CV</a>/<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisa-zhuojun-hou/">LinkedIn</a>, or even ping me on LinkedIn! </p>

	<p>Oh, and I got two cats. This girl's name is 小十五; in English, it's "little fifteen". <img src="cat.jpeg" alt="Xiao Shi Wu" style="width: 400px;" class="rotate90"> </p>
